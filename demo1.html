    <h2>firt wash is available</h2>
    <p>A car wash, or auto wash is a facility used to clean the exterior, and in some cases the interior, of cars.
        Car washes can be self-service, full-service (with attendants who wash the vehicle), or fully automated
        (possibly connected to a filling station). Car washes may also be events where people pay to have their cars
        washed by volunteers, often using less specialized equipment, as a fundraiser.
